## Test Coverage for Python
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kayondo-edward/python_test_coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kayondo-edward/python_test_coverage)

### steps to get you started
## Here is how it Work
## Step One (Setting up travis)
1. Signup to [travis](travis-ci.com) with Github
2. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
3. Click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
4. Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.

```
    # Identify language and version
    language: python
    python:
        - "3.6"
    # command to install dependencies
    install:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - pip install coveralls
    # command to run tests
    script:
    # Run pytest
        - pytest
    # step two
    after_success:
        coveralls
```    
5. Add the `.travis.yml` file to git, commit and push, to trigger a Travis CI build.
6. Check the build status page to see if your build `passes` or `fails`, according to the return status of the build command by visiting the `Travis CI` and selecting your repository.

## Step Two (setting up coveralls)
`coveralls.io` is one of the cloud-based services that can collect and display test coverage reports. It is free for Open Source projects hosted on `GitHub` or `BitBucket`.

1. Make sure Travis-CI is already enabled for your project and the tests pass.

2. Register on the `Coveralls`. web site using your `GitHub` account. Look for the "`Add repos`" button, select the GitHub repo that you'd like to enable.

3. You already have a `.travis.yml` file in the root of your repository, now you only need to add a few more entries.

```
 # Identify language and version
    language: python
    python:
        - "3.6"
    # command to install dependencies
    install:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - pip install pytest
        - pip install pytest-cov
        - pip install coveralls
    # command to run tests
    script:
        - pytest --cov=test_coverage/
    # step two
    after_success:
        coveralls
```
The important part is to install `pytest`, `pytest-cov `that allows us to generate the coverage report locally. (Meaning on the `Travis-CI` server.) We also need to install `coveralls` that can submit the the report to the `Coveralls.io`.

In the script part we need to run `pytest` with the `--cov` flag. You don't need to give a parameter to that `flag`, but then you might get reports on code that is not relevant to your application. It is better to pass the directory name of your module to it like `--cov=test_coverage/` so the coverage report will be restricted to code in that directory.

You also need to tell Travis-CI to run the `coveralls` command after the test ran successfully.

That's it. Your coverage reports should start flowing to `Coveralls.io`
