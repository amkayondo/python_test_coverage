### steps to get you started
1. Signup to [travis](travis-ci.com) with Github
2. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
3. Click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
4. Add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do.

```
    # Identify language and version
    language: python
    python:
        - "3.6"
    # command to install dependencies
    install:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - pip install coveralls
    # command to run tests
    script:
        - python numbers.py cov
    
    after_success:
        coveralls
```    
5. Add the `.travis.yml` file to git, commit and push, to trigger a Travis CI build.
6. Check the build status page to see if your build `passes` or `fails`, according to the return status of the build command by visiting the `Travis CI` and selecting your repository.
